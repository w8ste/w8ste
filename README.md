### Hey, welcome to my profile ^^
My name is Hannes and i currently study computer science at TU Darmstadt.
Besides studying and coding, i also like to read, listen to lofi and play around 
with linux (I use arch btw).
I also consider myself a trackball enthusiast, interested in stationary and a speedcuber.
